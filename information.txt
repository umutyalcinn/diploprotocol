Website Corrections
Home Page
1. The logo on the toolbar looks as if it is stuck on, and the background behind the CD logo needs to be removed. At the moment, the logo looks like an image, whereas it should be blended into the background, meaning there should be no visible frame around it.
2. The green color needs to be unified, as three different shades are currently visible. Wherever green appears on the website, it should be the same green color, in a single consistent tone.
3. Language selection with flags (CG - Montenegrin and UK - English) is visible on desktop but not on mobile devices.
4. The slogan "Where Prestige Meets Perfection" should be highlighted and separated from the title "High-Level Events & VIP Diplomatic Protocol" (remove Diplomatic).
5. The homepage video should be changed to start with a scene of luxury cars and drivers (if possible with flags bearing the CG logo), followed by a welcome scene and a private jet, people in suits in front of the private jet, and entering the car (red carpet, people dressed in black business suits, security with earpieces, and professionally dressed women).
6. Remove the text at the bottom of the page ("We are a Montenegrin company founded..."), as it is not part of our text.
(Use the initial text we previously sent to you.)
7. Our Services should be in gold color.
8. Replace the photos so that all images are business-oriented and luxurious:
a. Protocol Advisory - a photo of an airport reception
b. Meeting & Summit Organization - a photo of a large summit with participants
c. Events Planning & Management - a photo of an award ceremony on a large stage (everyone in suits)
d. Engage Our Professional Team - a photo of men and women in equal numbers, smiling, professionally dressed in black suits, standing in front of a luxury limousine (welcoming guests)
e. Networking & Strategic Connections - a photo of several people gathered in a circle, seated and talking
f. Exclusive Guest Hospitality - a man and a woman, professionally dressed, escorting a guest
g. Corporate Image & Reputation - one man and two women writing something on a board or planner
h. Ethics & Cultural Consultancy - a photo of a handshake where suits are visible, not just shirts
i. VIP Transfer & Reception - a photo of a vehicle fleet, several Mercedes cars with CD markings (if possible)
9. Exclusive Personal VIP Services, including Services Highlights, should be removed, as this is not our text.
10. Diplomatic Protocol Academy should be carefully and specially highlighted, ??????????? on a green background with gold text (filigree-style design, luxurious and powerful).
11. The introductory text for Diplomatic Protocol Academy should be replaced with the text sent to the group by Mr. Klaric in the message dated October 21, which reads:
At the Diplomatic Protocol Academy, we empower organizations to elevate their standards of professionalism, service, and client engagement. Our exclusive programs are designed to train executives, teams, and staff in the art of diplomatic protocol, corporate etiquette, and high-level business communication.

About Us - should be designed more powerfully; currently there is too much empty space.
Use the text we previously sent to you.
The photo with the bottle and glass is not appropriate. It is acceptable to use a photo that includes VIP elements on a table, but it should not be central as it is now, rather positioned to the side.
12. Who We Are on a green background should have gold lettering, and the continuation of the text, separated by a photo, should also be on a green background written in gold letters.
13. Our Mission and Our Vision should keep the existing solution with a gold background, but the text should be written in green.
14. Our Core Values should be removed, as they are not included in the previously sent text.
15. Remove Our Leadership, but leave the possibility to implement this content later, in a few months.

Our Services
16. The text on the green background should be written in gold color.
17. Present all nine services instead of the current six, and color them as previously suggested.
IMPORTANT!!! In the descriptions, use the text for all 9 services that we sent in the previous document; the existing text is not good.

Event Types - add slight animation, remove Royal Weddings and add Summit & High-Security Events.

Diplomatic Protocol Academy
18. This segment should be treated in a filigree style and designed powerfully.
19. The dropdown menu should be on a beige background with gold-colored titles.
20. The entire text, as in other parts of the website, should be written in gold on a green background.
21. The introductory text should be replaced with our text, as should also be done on the Home Page:
USE THE TEXT FROM THE PREVIOUS DOCUMENT

22. Our Approach, like the other Academy segments, should not have a title; instead, the proposed text should be placed immediately under Our Approach, and How We Design and Deliver Training should be deleted.
23. After the third paragraph, the four indicated sentences should be deleted, as they are not part of our text.
24. For Programs & Training Levels, the title should be removed, and the text should be written directly under Programs & Trainings.
25. After the text "Our programs include", visually separate the following sections:
• Developing and deepening understanding of etiquette - mastering the rules of polite, cultured, and professional conduct applicable in all business and diplomatic contexts.
• Mastering principles of diplomatic and corporate protocol - aligned with contemporary international standards, enabling confident and elegant navigation of formal events and meetings.
